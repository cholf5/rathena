# Restore `Author` Metadata in `doc/script_lua.md`

## Issue

The document header had 3 metadata fields originally, but `Author` was dropped during a rewrite while `Last Updated` and `Status` remained.

## Change

Updated `/Users/cholf5/dev/rathena/doc/script_lua.md` header to restore:

- `Author: GPT-5.3-Codex`

## Result

Header metadata is back to 3 lines and consistent.
